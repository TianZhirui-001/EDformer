Here, we show how to do Learning-to-Optimize on both IEEE 9-Bus and 39-Bus systems and show how to add multi-task learning into the Encoder-Decoder structure. At the same time, we provide some convenient toolboxes, such as parameters of IEEE 9-Bus and 39-Bus systems and the code of ICEEMDAN. If you need further code, such as how to add parameter-sharing in multi-task learning, please contact me via zhiruitian@link.cuhk.edu.cn.
