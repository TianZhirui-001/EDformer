Here, we show how to do Learning-to-Optimize on both IEEE 9-Bus and 39-Bus systems to get day-ahead ED cost instead of the traditional solver. At the same time, we provide some convenient toolboxes, such as parameters of IEEE 9-Bus and 39-Bus systems and the code of ICEEMDAN. If you need further code, such as how to establish an Encoder-Decoder structure and how to add parameter-sharing in multi-task learning, please contact me via zhiruitian@link.cuhk.edu.cn.
